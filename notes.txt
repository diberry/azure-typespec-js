There is a little dependency issue that I'll need to talk to Tim about once he's in the office, but for right now what works for me in the repo is:
change the dependency version for every package from latest to next in the package.json
For @typespec/compiler only, change the version to 1.1.0-dev.2 -- only this version has a new API function that the next version of HSJS needs and just setting "@typespec/compiler": "next" doesn't seem to work right now, which is what I'll need to talk to Tim about.
Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then run npm i --force --no-package-lock to force NPM to reacquire the new versions.
None of these steps should be required once these packages are fully published, but this should get you on the latest development version of everything right away.
